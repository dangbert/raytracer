Status:
* my calculated values are the same as professors, except:
    his output:
        left limit: -1.69647
        top limit: 1.69647
    mine:
        initX: -1.70057
        initY: -1.70057

Tested so far:
* Polygon creates triangle fan correctly
* triangle ray intersection might be working??? needs more testing
* my calculated initX and initY differ from the teacher's
